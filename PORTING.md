# Port coverage

The gallery covers every example in `openfl/away3d-samples`. “Reused” means the mature Flight port
from `flighthq-ports/awayjs-examples` was brought across and adapted to this repository. “Remastered”
means the OpenFL sample was implemented directly with current Flight APIs and a current material and
lighting treatment.

## Flight capability gaps

The samples keep these gaps visible instead of silently converting the input or dropping the feature:

- **COLLADA/DAE import:** Flight exposes scene importers for AWD2, OBJ, 3DS, MD2, MD5, and glTF, but
  no COLLADA importer. `load-dae` fetches and inspects the original carousel document and reports its
  contents. Rendering that asset remains blocked on a Flight COLLADA importer.
- **Spatial light probes:** Flight can bake a global image-based-lighting environment and create point
  lights, but the scene API has no local probe volumes with spatial interpolation. `light-probes`
  combines the original environment with four local colored point lights.
- **Planar reflection capture:** The scene renderer has no Away3D-style planar reflection texture with
  an oblique clip plane. `planar-reflections` keeps the moving reflected subject and mirror composition
  through an explicit mirrored-scene fallback.
- **Dynamic environment capture:** Flight can upload cube faces and bake static IBL, but it has no
  scene-level helper that renders six views into a live environment cube. `real-time-env-map` uses the
  original sky cube as static IBL while preserving the moving subject and reflective PBR head.

Compressed AWD assets in the Onkba, polar bear, and clock samples are supported. Those examples call
`registerDeflateDecompressor()` before parsing, then use the imported skeleton clips or named clock
meshes directly.
